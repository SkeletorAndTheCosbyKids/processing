# Notes

* Do the rectangular maps represent a projected radius of the planet sphere? 
	* It is not realistic to display an entire planet hemisphere on the screen.  
	* Some resources for calculating projections:

			* See: Near-side perspective maps simulate views from space

	* Processing stuff to explore:

* Efficiency:
	* Create an array of masks, and cycle through them?
	* Use a single mask that is incremented?
	* Single mask and array of images?
